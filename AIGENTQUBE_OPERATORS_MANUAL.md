# AigentQube Operators Manual: Early Access Prototype v0.1.0

## 🌐 System Overview
AigentQube is an advanced contextual intelligence platform designed to dynamically adapt AI agents to specific user contexts, enabling personalized and intelligent interactions across multiple domains.

## 🤖 Current Prototype Capabilities

### Agent Ecosystem
#### Agent Types
1. **Generic Agents**
   - Base-level intelligence
   - Broad, generalized capabilities
   - Minimal domain-specific expertise

2. **Specialized Agents**
   - Domain-specific intelligence
   - Adaptive context recognition
   - Enhanced interaction models

### Agent Status Monitoring
Our current dashboard provides real-time insights into agent operational states:

#### Status Indicators
- `active` (🟢): Fully operational
  * Ready for task assignment
  * Complete system connectivity
  * Optimal performance parameters

- `processing` (🟡): Engaged in active task
  * Currently executing assigned work
  * Resource allocation in progress
  * Temporary reduced availability

- `inactive` (🔴): Non-operational
  * System offline
  * Requires diagnostic intervention
  * Potential connectivity issues

### Contextual Intelligence Metrics

#### Context Depth
Represents the agent's contextual understanding:
- Numerical scale (0-10)
- Higher numbers indicate:
  * More extensive memory
  * Complex task handling
  * Richer interaction capabilities

#### Blockchain Synchronization
Tracks agent's blockchain network integration:
- `✓ Synced`: Full blockchain connectivity
  * Latest smart contract states loaded
  * Transaction history synchronized
  * Blockchain-based trust verification active

- `✗ Not Synced`: Partial or no blockchain connection
  * Potential data inconsistencies
  * Limited blockchain-based functionality
  * Requires network reconnection
