# Metis API Integration Resolution Notes

## Network and CORS Issues Resolution

### Problem Identification
- Initial implementation of Metis API integration was causing network connectivity issues
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors were preventing successful API calls
- Initialization and service query methods were overly complex and not aligned with the API's expected request format

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Simplified API Request Methodology
- Switched from complex POST requests to straightforward GET requests
- Used `URL` and `URLSearchParams` for constructing query URLs
- Removed unnecessary headers and complex CORS configuration

#### 2. Endpoint-Specific Routing
- Added domain-specific endpoint routing
  - Default `/service` endpoint for general queries
  - Specific `/teaching` endpoint for AI Coach domain

#### 3. Error Handling Improvements
- Simplified error logging and handling
- Maintained basic error tracking and reporting
- Removed overly complex retry and circuit breaker mechanisms

### Code Modifications

#### MetisIntegration.ts Changes
- Updated `initialize()` method to use a simple POST request with minimal payload
- Modified `execute()` method to:
  - Use GET requests
  - Support domain-specific endpoints
  - Simplify URL parameter handling
- Removed complex CORS and network error handling
- Streamlined error reporting

### Specific Network and CORS Resolution Strategies
1. Use simple GET requests with URL parameters
2. Minimal header configuration
3. Remove complex CORS middleware
4. Rely on server-side CORS configuration
5. Simplify error handling and logging

### Recommended Future Improvements
- Implement more robust error tracking
- Add more detailed logging for debugging
- Consider adding optional timeout and retry mechanisms if needed

## Example Usage

```typescript
// General service query
await metisIntegration.execute({ input: "Your query" });

// AI Coach domain query
await metisIntegration.execute({ 
  input: "Your teaching query", 
  domain: "AI Coach" 
});
```

## Notes for Developers
- Always ensure the Metis API endpoint is correctly configured
- Verify API key is properly set in environment variables
- Check network settings and firewall configurations if issues persist
